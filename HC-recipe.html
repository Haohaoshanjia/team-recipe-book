        Place a slice of vegetarian ham and cheese inside each mushroom cap,

        Prepare three bowls: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with
        breadcrumbs mixed with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.

        Dip each mushroom sandwich first in flour, then in egg, and finally coat
        with breadcrumbs.
